I am Bhagyashree Aras, a graduate student at Seattle University, Washington, majoring in Computer Science. I have more than an 18-month industry working experience as a System analyst after I obtained my first masterâ€™s degree(MBA). During my industry experience, I developed an interest in the technical domain thus took a transition to the computer science field to develop an understanding of software engineering. Currently, I am looking for an internship as a Software Engineer. I am a solid software developer with a bunch of development experience in C++, Java, Python. 

1. I believe, if you think you can do it. You will do it. So no need to limit yourself. 
2. I love talking, reading, writing, dancing, painting, sketching, and cooking. Cooking is like therapy to me. Eventually, my interest turned to food blogging. In      the year 2020, I started Delish Platter (https://delishplatter.com/).
